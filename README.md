In this CA assigment we were tasked to create a properly functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief we chose in Design 1. I started with reading and watching module 1 and doing the lesson tasks. HTML was the first thing I did. Luckily this year the teachers made checkpoints for us to do after each module. I also read and wathced a lot of info about the subject. First I started with the homepage/index, then I added the background for that page. At first all my pages had this background but later I found out that it was cooler with only the index have the background and the other pages black background.

CSS was easier after I understood how I could controll everything with classes. Before I got that I just tried everything down the code until something happened. When I grasped classes and how to style them it became easier. At one point I felt like I was "swimming" in CSS and I had problems to take it all in. So I made a document were I wrote down exactly what CSS controlled what HTML.

I didnt know before way later that I should have started designing for mobile first. I read that in module 3, but when I was at module 3 I was too far in my desktop design to go back. So I had to read a LOT of stuff to understand how to scale it down afterwards. This was no easy task as I struggled with understanding media queries. So a lot of time was devouted to scaling down. But you live and learn so I know what to do the next time I'm making a responsive website. A lot of the process was trying and failing, deleting and adding in dev.tools to see what was happening to the pages. Dev.tools was my saviour! I learned very much from this tool and it will be an great asset in the future. After many weeks (up tp the last week actually) I used all my time on the mobile view to get it right. Then I runned all my pages through the "wave" and the "w3" validator. I got a lot of errors and I spent the rest of the time correcting them. Some errors I had to ask my teacher Abidev and my class for help with. They were a great resource to me and always gave me constructive critiqe.
I have tried my best writing the code in DRY principles but that was also a hard task. That had a lot to do with me not starting writing DRY, but fixing it afterwards. In one example I tried to make all the lines; "color: var(--main-text-color);" in one code, but then all my pages was altered. Since its only 24 hours to delivery I think it be best not to screw up my whole CA. I tried cleaning up my code to the best of my knowledge, wich is not very big.

In this report I have explained how I delivered a website with the target audience in mind. This assigment was a very fun experience that gave me a lot of things to consider. Most of all I took this assigment as a way to learn the basics of html and css. Before this assigment I knew virtually nothing, now I know something.
