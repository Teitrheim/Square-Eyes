In this CA assignment, the task was to create a properly functioning, responsive website for the chosen assignment brief from Design 1. The development process involved learning and implementing HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles.

## Description

I. HTML Development:

Started by studying module 1 and completing lesson tasks.
Implemented HTML, with a particular focus on the homepage/index.

II. CSS Styling:

Initially struggled with CSS but gained proficiency after understanding the role of classes in controlling styling.
Created a document to track which CSS rules applied to specific HTML elements.
Learned to use classes effectively, making CSS more manageable.

III. Responsive Design Challenges:

Realized later that designing for mobile-first was advisable (learned in module 3).
Faced challenges in scaling down the existing desktop design.
Devoted significant time to understand media queries and ensure responsiveness.

IV. Debugging and Tools:

Faced challenges in the process, involving trial and error, and using dev tools extensively.
Utilized dev tools for debugging and gaining insights into the structure and style of the pages.

V. Validation and Corrections:

Ran all pages through the "Wave" and "W3" validator tools.
Encountered errors and spent time correcting them, seeking help from the teacher and classmates.
Strived to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, improving the code.

VI. Finalization:

Given the time constraints, focused on refining the mobile view in the last week.
Strived for clean and organized code, considering the DRY principles.

This assignment provided a valuable learning experience, especially in understanding the basics of HTML and CSS. While facing challenges, the iterative process of trial and error, combined with the use of dev tools, contributed to the overall learning curve.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this CA assignment was a fun and enriching experience that provided insights into web development. The challenges encountered, from understanding responsive design to debugging, contributed to the development of skills and knowledge.
